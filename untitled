Live Edition of Slackware 15.0 (64-bit stable)
https://slackware.nl/slackware-live/slackware64-15.0-live/

Slackwareâ„¢ is a trademark of Patrick Volkerding.

Why was Slackware created?
Patrick Volkerding didn't set out to create a Linux distribution. He just wanted to simplify the process of installing and configuring Softlanding Linux System. But when SLS didn't pick up his improvements, Volkerding decided to release his work as Slackware.

Nice! I like the colors and simplicity. I'd suggest linking to the Wiki and the Slackbook as well.

I don't get the rejection by other redditors. If anything, having more websites about Slackware is good. I've not been around as long as many other Slackware users but the community sites could definitely use some UX/UI improvements.

It would certainly invite more people to participate and update some entries.

You definitely made the right call by including unofficial in the title, perhaps with time it can be part of the official.

The features page looks a bit ugly. I mean, some icons are too thick, there are not enough tiles, which is why the space is empty, there are no XFCE tile, and the KDE icon has a background. I would also like the download button for the 15th version and the current version to have a link to iso file not the slackware live folder, which does not have an iso file.

Anyway I would prefer to stumble upon this site first, before downloading Slackware, this website looks cool and very easy to navigate!
